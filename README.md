# MakersBnB

## Headline specifications:

+ Any signed-up user can list a new space.
+ Users can list multiple spaces.
+ Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
+ Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
+ Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
+ Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
+ Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

## Required technologies:

+ BCrypt, 
+ DB sql, either Ruby-based (Active Record/DataMapper etc.)/JavaScript-based (node.js)/express `DECISION POINT`
+ Heroku
+ HTML
+ JavaScript, jQuery (probably)
+ 
+ Bootstrap (nice to have )

+ Tue - research + setting up DB, back end `working DB by the end of the day`
